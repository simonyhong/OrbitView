Software that visualizes recorded-3D-eye movements<br><br> 
It is a tool that converts the measured eye movement data into a three-dimensional (3D) movie of eye movements. Having useful functions such as slow-play, pause and exaggeration of the movements, this software provides a research and teaching tool to better interpret the recorded eye movements.<br>
